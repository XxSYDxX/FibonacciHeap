# FibonacciHeap
 The C++ implementation of the Fibonacci Heap Data Structure

This is my implementation of the Fibonacci Heap Data Structure.
I made it in a day, so it must have a lot of undetected bugs. Please let me know if you find any.
This implementation might not be the most efficient, but everything is consisent with the theory.
Let me know if you find any inconsistency as well.

The following operations have been implemented:
1) Make Node
2) Insert Node
3) Extract Min or Delete Min

4) Decrease Key
